        Performs queries on the underlying log storage against a time range and
        set of dimension values. Additionally, it is possible to optionally
        sort results by timestamp.

        :param tenant_id:
            Tenant/project id for which to obtain logs (required).
        :param region:
            Region for which to obtain logs (required).
        :param dimensions:
            List of Dimension tuples containing pairs of dimension names and
            optional lists of dimension values. These will be used to filter
            the logs returned. If no dimensions are specified, then no
            filtering is performed. When multiple values are given, the
            dimension must match any of the given values. If None is given,
            logs with any value for the dimension will be returned.
        :param start_time:
            Optional starting time in UNIX time (integer seconds, inclusive).
        :param end_time:
            Optional ending time in UNIX time (integer seconds, inclusive).

            Number of matching results to skip past, if specified.
        :param limit:
            Number of matching results to return (required).
        :param sort_by:
            List of SortBy tuples specifying fields to sort by and the
            direction to sort the result set by. e.g. ('timestamp','asc'). The
            direction is specified by either the string 'asc' for ascending
            direction, or 'desc' for descending. If not specified, no order
            must be enforced and the implementation is free to choose the most
            efficient method to return the results.
